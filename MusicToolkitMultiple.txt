'MacroName:MusicToolkitMultiple
'MacroDescription: Runs the OCLC Music Toolkit (and potentially other macros) on a list of local save file records, one at a time. Execute from the list screen.
'Detailed instructions:
'1)	(Make sure the OCLC Music Toolkit is installed in its own right first!)
'2)	Pick your records to enhance
'3)	Save them to a local save file
'4)	Open the save file list screen
'5)	Run the MusicToolkitMultiple macro
'6)	Watch as it opens each record in turn and runs the Music Toolkit, then resaves the record. 
'7)	Unless the Toolkit (or any of the other macros you add) pops up a dialog box (which requires clicking to dismiss it), this can run through your whole file without intervention. 
'8)	Once the records are modified in the save file, you can then review and replace them as desired. Donâ€™t forget to refine and amend the machine-generated fields as needed (and please follow MLA best practices!).
